Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 
Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 

Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

Java Solution - 

class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int count = (int)(Math.log(num) /  Math.log(2) + 1);
        for(int i=0;i<count;i++){
            num = (num^(1<<i));
        }
        return num;
    }
}
